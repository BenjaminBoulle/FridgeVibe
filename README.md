Rails app generated with [lewagon/rails-templates](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates), created during #Batch1026 of the Le Wagon Web development bootcamp.

FridgeVibe is a project, meant to reduce the drastic amounts of food waste produced every year in the European Union alone. Think of it as digital list of 
what groceries you have at home and when they will expire. You can keep the list up to date in your home fridge and generate recipe ideas any time by 
clicking a button. The algorithm will order the list by two factors:

  1.) How many ingredients I have at home match the ingredients needed for the recipe. 
  2.) While prioritizing recipes that require ingredients that will expire soon in order to consume them first. 
  
You can then see which ingredients, if any, are missing. The application is meant to help reduce the food you waste, simplify cooking at home which is 
usually healthier than eating out and conveninely supply you with new recipe ideas to try out. 

🌟 About the Project
